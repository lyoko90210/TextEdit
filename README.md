## Usage
1. Users can create and edit notes or code snippets directly in the browser. This is useful for developers and anyone needing to jot down quick notes or code.

2. The application is a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning it can function without an internet connection. Users can continue working on their notes even when offline, and the data will be saved locally.
 
 3. This app uses IndexedDB for data storage, so that users' notes are saved and can be retrieved later, even if they close and reopen the browser.

 4. Users can install the web application as a standalone app on their desktop.
